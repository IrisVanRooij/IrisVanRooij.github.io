I'm Iris van Rooij, a psychologist and cognitive scientist.

This "metatheorist" blog is to share ideas and news related, but not limited, to my [NIAS](https://nias.knaw.nl) project _Tools for theory: Improving the theoretical foundations of psychological science_.

 To learn more about me visit my [homepage](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/IrisVanRooij) or read this [interview](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/making-invisible-problems-visible1.pdf).

 If you are interested in how computational theories of cognition can scale beyond toy domains to the real world then check out the [Cognition and Intractability](https://cognitionandintractability.com) book.

### Why this blog format?

While I have [blogposts](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/posts/) on my personal website, I created this stand alone [GitHub](https://github.com) hosted blog to train some skills. I purposely chose simplicity of layout to focus on content over form.
