I'm a psychologist and computational cognitive scientist at Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour 
at Radboud University. My research focuses on the scope and limits of theories of cognition.

### Why this blog format?

While I have [blogposts](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/posts/) on my personal website, I created this stand alone [GitHub](https://github.com) hosted blog to train some skills. I purposely chose simplicity of layout to focus on content over form.
