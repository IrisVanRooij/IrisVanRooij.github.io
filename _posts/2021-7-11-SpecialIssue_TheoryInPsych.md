Finally, the special issue on *Theory in Psychological Science*, edited by Travis Proulx and Richard Morey, is out!

Some papers in this issue have been up on PsyArXiv since early 2020 or even 2019, but now all have been compiled and published in *Perspectives on Psychological Scienc*. Check out the full Table of Contents [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/pps/16/4).

Over the last year, I wrote '[Now reading](https://metatheorist.com/Now-Reading/)'-threads about some of the papers in this issue (either as preprint or in published form). Below an overview of the papers, in alphabetical order, with links to their threads.
