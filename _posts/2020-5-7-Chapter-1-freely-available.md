><img align="right" width="250"  src="/images/book_cover_small.png">  As all good modeling introductions, the book starts by considering pizzas [[^1]]. We use the :pizza: example to illustrate the phenomenon of combinatorial explosion and how it can induce computational intractability of models of cognition (in this case, decision making). Chapter 1 also includes short primers on the Conceptual Foundations of Cognitive Explanation, and of Computability and Tractability.
